</p>

A modern, privacy-focused web application designed to help you batch generate calendar events for Apple Calendar (and other .ICS compatible apps). Perfect for quickly scheduling work shifts, vacations, or recurring project blocks.

## Live Demo

[👉 **Open Application**](https://frankq76.github.io/AppleCalendarBatchEvent/)

## Features

- **Batch Selection**: Click to select multiple dates on an interactive calendar grid.
- **Smart Time Ranges**: Set start and end times, or toggle "All Day" events.
- **Saved Events**: Create, edit, and manage presets for your frequent event types (e.g., "Work: 9-5", "Gym", "Vacation").
- **Custom Alerts**: Configure up to two alerts per event (e.g., 15 minutes before, 1 day before).
- **Privacy First**: Runs entirely in your browser. No data is sent to any server.
- **Dark Mode**: Beautiful, eye-friendly dark interface.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Optimized for touch devices.

## How to Use

1. **Set Event Details**: Enter a title (e.g., "Work") and choose the time range.
2. **Select Dates**: Tap the dates on the calendar where this event should occur.
3. **Save Presets**: (Optional) Save your configuration as a preset for one-tap access later.
4. **Download**: Click "Download .ICS File" and open the file to import all events into your calendar app immediately.

## Deployment

This is a **Static Single Page Application (SPA)** contained in a single file.

- **No Backend Required**

The application runs immediately in any modern browser.
